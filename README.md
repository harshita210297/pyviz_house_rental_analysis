# Unit 6: Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco

## Proptech Analysis: San Francisco Real-Estate
The aim of this project is to analyze the real-estate market in San Francisco using data visualization methods. The goal is to identify possible investment opportunities as a proptech company that offers an instant, one-click service for buying and renting properties.

## About
PropTech is a domain in the FinTech industry that applies technologies to real-estate markets. In this project, data from the San Francisco real-estate market will be used as a trial. This project, if successful, can then be expanded to support other cities in the future. The main Python packages that will be used to create visualizations are hvPlot and GeoViews. By applying data visualization methods, it is possible to decipher valuable information about the market and discover potential investment opportunities. This could become a valuable tool that simplifies and streamlines the process of buying real-estate and renting properties.  


## To start
To run the Jupyter notebook and interact with the visualizations, you need to have the following software and Python libraries installed:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Anaconda Distribution

```

## Usage
> **_NOTE:_**  The visualizations of the interactive plots do not show up in the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. Please clone or download the project to interact with the plots.

You can clone or download this GitHub project and open the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is seperated into sections that cover different aspects of the analysis. Each section contains explanations, code snippets, and interactive visualizations. By executing each cell in the Jupyter Notebook you can then interact with the visualizations.
